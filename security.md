# Security

There are three types of users in the system:
- Internal users
- Portal users
- Public users

### Internal users
These have full access to the system and can perform any operation. They can be administrators, agents, or any other role that requires full access to the system.

### Portal
A portal user can be a customer or a supplier, with access to only relevant documents.

### Public
This user can only access the website. The public user could sign up and become a portal user.

## Models/Records

Rules can be applied to an entire model or to a specific record.

You can apply those rules 'globally' or to a specific group.
